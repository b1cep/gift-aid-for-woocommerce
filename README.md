## Installation

1. Upload the `woocommerce-gift-aid` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the plugin in the 'Products' tab of the WooCommerce settings

## Known Issues

Due to the fact that WooCommerce core is missing the ability to use either of the following to populate a more appropriate tab with our settings we're having to put them in the *Products* tab for now.

`woocommerce_get_settings_checkout`

`woocommerce_get_settings_tax`
